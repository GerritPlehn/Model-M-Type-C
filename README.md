# Model M Type C

This is a project with the simple goal of recreating the old IBM Model M keyboard controller with modern technologies in mind.

## Incentive
Although the IBM Model M is perhaps the most well-known and popular of old keyboards, it isn't equipped with some modern ameneties we have grown used to enjoying. Key features that the Model M lacks are Windows and Media keys(or, broader, firmware-level repogramability), as well as a hotswappable connection with a modern interface. This controller is designed to bring 21st century features to a 20th century keyboard.

## Goals
- Native USB C
- Hotswappable
- Fully configurable with QMK compatibility
- Less power draw
- Complete reversability
